# manim-timeline: A Fun Recap of Literature Review!

This repository is meant to complement [manim-slides](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides), and does not override it. 

The manim-timeline repository contains code that elegantly integrates historical events (such as philosopher's quotes or captioned images) 
with time-stamped publications as well as offer simple transitions to full-screen demos. This presentation mode is much more fun
and interactive than typical PowerPoint slides; it allows the presenter to provide historical context, rapid coverage of related work, 
and how this led to more recent advancements in the field of interest. manim-slides also utilizes [manim-beamer](https://github.com/johnHostetter/manim-beamer)
so intermittent slides on the timeline are styled similar to LaTeX Beamer for additional professionalism.
